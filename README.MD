## Running the app
- Each project has its own README.md file. Please read the instructions before running the `run_project.sh` script.
- Run the `run_project.sh` bash script
- This will only work if you have installed the pre-requisites eg Docker and NodeJs
- `nohup.out` saves the logs generated by the apps

```bash
# Run from the project root

$ sh run_project.sh
```
